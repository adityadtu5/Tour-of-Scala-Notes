Expressions are computable statements.

Referencing a value does not recompute it.

The result of the last expression in a block is the result of the block too.

Functions are expressions that have parameters and takes arguments.

Methods are defined using `def` keyword. Methods can take multiple parameter lists or no parameter list at all.

Class constructor is declared along with class signature.

Case classes are immutable and are compared by value (unlike classes who are compared by reference). This makes them useful for pattern matching.

Objects are single instances (singletons) of their own definition.

Traits are abstract data types containing certain fields and methods. Traits can also have default implementation.

Traits can be extended by a class using `extends` keyword and its method can be overridden.

`main` method is the entrypoint of a program and is takes one argument - array of strings. In Scala3, with the `@main` annotation, a main method is automatically generated from a method.
