Traits are used to share interfaces and fields between classes. Traits can not be initialised. Objects can extend traits.

Traits can be used as generic types and with the abstract methods.

Use `extends` keyword to extend a trait and `override` keyword to implement its abstract methods.

Where a given `trait` is required a subtype of trait can also be used.
